# keystone-bank

## Installation 

1. Make sure you've installed [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/) server. 
After, navigate into the directory where xampp is installed. Open a terminal in this location. 
2. You will need to have some way to authenticate yourself before running anything Git related. GitHub deprecated password authentication
so you will probably need an SSH key to authenticate yourself. 
3. Once you're authenticated, run `git clone https://github.com/deathbymanatee/keystone-bank.git` in the C:\\xampp\htdocs directory. You will probably need 
administrative privileges to modify this directory. 

I will ask about how the file structure should look and make the appropriate changes. For now, don't many any crazy changes just yet (main is protected anyway)
