# keystone-bank

## Installation 

1. Make sure you've installed [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/) server. 
After, navigate into the directory where xampp is installed. Open a terminal in this location. 
2. You will need to have some way to authenticate yourself before running anything Git related. GitHub deprecated password authentication
so you will probably need an SSH key to authenticate yourself. 
3. Once you're authenticated, run `git clone https://github.com/deathbymanatee/keystone-bank.git` in the `C:\\xampp\htdocs` directory. You will probably need 
administrative privileges to modify this directory. 
4. To test if everything installed correctly, start the xampp web server and type in `localhost/keystone-bank/HelloWorld.php` your browser and hit enter. You should see the contents of that file printed out on your screen

I will ask about how the file structure should look and make the appropriate changes. For now, don't many any crazy changes just yet (main is protected anyway)
